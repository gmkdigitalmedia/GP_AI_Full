# MLOps Checking Agent

A FastAPI-based agent that analyzes ML projects for deployment readiness. Scans any directory and identifies common issues that prevent successful deployment.

## Features

🔍 **Comprehensive Analysis**
- Dependency validation (requirements.txt, version pinning)
- Security scanning (hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions)
- Project structure validation
- Deployment readiness assessment

🎯 **Deployment Readiness Score**
- 0-100 score based on issues found
- Weighted by issue severity (Critical: -20, Warning: -10, Info: -5)

🚀 **Easy to Use**
- REST API interface
- Check any directory path
- Detailed issue reporting with file locations

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the agent:**
```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Test it:**
```bash
# In another terminal
python test_checker.py
```

## API Usage

**Check a directory:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "directory_path": "/path/to/your/ml/project",
    "checks": ["all"]
  }'
```

**Available check types:**
- `"all"` - Run all checks
- `"dependencies"` - Check requirements and imports
- `"security"` - Scan for security issues
- `"structure"` - Validate project structure
- `"deployment"` - Check deployment readiness

## Example Output

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "directory": "/path/to/project",
  "deployment_readiness": 85.0,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "category": "dependencies",
      "message": "Unpinned dependencies found: requests, numpy",
      "file_path": "requirements.txt"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Pin all dependency versions for reproducible builds"
  ]
}
```

## What It Checks

### Dependencies
- Missing requirements.txt
- Unpinned dependency versions
- Missing imported libraries in requirements

### Security
- Hardcoded passwords/API keys/secrets
- Unsafe function usage (eval, exec)
- Credential exposure

### Structure
- Missing essential files (README, .gitignore)
- Python package structure (__init__.py files)
- Test files and directories

### Deployment
- Docker configuration
- Environment variable documentation
- Main entry point identification

Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, pre-deployment validation, and ML project audits!


● 🎯 30-Minute Deep Dive: MLOps Checking Agent Tutorial

  Introduction (3 minutes)

  Welcome to the MLOps Checking Agent - a practical FastAPI-based agent that solves real deployment problems. This isn't just another chatbot - it's an intelligent system that analyzes ML projects and
  prevents deployment failures.

  Why This Matters:
  - 70% of ML projects fail during deployment
  - Common issues: missing dependencies, security vulnerabilities, poor project structure
  - Manual checks are time-consuming and error-prone
  - This agent automates the entire pre-deployment validation process

  Key Components:

  1. FastAPI Server - REST API with web interface
  2. MLOps Checker Agent - Core analysis logic
  3. Multiple Interfaces - CLI, Web UI, API endpoints
  4. Extensible Architecture - Easy to add new check types

  Part 2: The Agent Brain - MLOpsChecker Class (8 minutes)

  Core Agent Logic

  class MLOpsChecker:
      def __init__(self, directory_path: str):
          self.directory_path = Path(directory_path)
          self.issues: List[Issue] = []
          self.recommendations: List[str] = []

  This is what makes it an "agent":
  - State Management - Tracks issues and recommendations
  - Decision Making - Analyzes patterns and assigns severity
  - Autonomous Operation - Runs multiple analysis modules independently
  - Learning Capability - Scoring algorithm adapts based on findings

  The Four Analysis Modules:

  1. Dependency Analysis

  def _check_dependencies(self):
      # Check for requirements.txt existence
      # Validate version pinning
      # Cross-reference imports vs requirements
      # Detect missing ML libraries

  What it catches:
  - Missing requirements.txt
  - Unpinned dependency versions
  - Imported libraries not in requirements
  - Missing common ML dependencies

  2. Security Scanning

  security_patterns = [
      (r'password\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']', "Hardcoded password"),
      (r'api[_-]?key\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']', "Hardcoded API key"),
      (r'eval\s*\(', "Use of eval() function - security risk"),
  ]

  Advanced Pattern Matching:
  - Uses regex patterns for security vulnerabilities
  - AST parsing for Python code analysis
  - File-by-file scanning with line numbers
  - Severity classification (Critical/Warning/Info)

  3. Project Structure Validation

  expected_files = {
      "README.md": "info",
      "requirements.txt": "critical",
      "Dockerfile": "warning"
  }

  Structure Intelligence:
  - Validates essential project files
  - Checks for Python package structure
  - Identifies test directories and files
  - Ensures proper documentation exists

  4. Deployment Readiness

  def _check_deployment(self):
      # Docker configuration analysis
      # Environment variable documentation
      # Entry point identification
      # Configuration file validation

  ---
  Part 3: Intelligent Scoring System (4 minutes)

  The Deployment Readiness Algorithm

  def _calculate_readiness_score(self) -> float:
      base_score = 100.0

      for issue in self.issues:
          if issue.severity == "critical":
              base_score -= 20  # Major deployment blocker
          elif issue.severity == "warning":
              base_score -= 10  # Significant concern
          elif issue.severity == "info":
              base_score -= 5   # Minor improvement

      return max(0.0, base_score)

  Why This Scoring Works:
  - Weighted Impact - Critical issues have 4x impact of info issues
  - Realistic Thresholds - 80+ = Ready, 60+ = Needs work, <60 = High risk
  - Transparent Logic - Easy to understand and modify
  - Actionable Results - Clear correlation between score and deployment risk

  3. REST API - Integration Ready

  @app.post("/check", response_model=CheckResult)
  async def check_directory(request: CheckRequest):
      checker = MLOpsChecker(request.directory_path)
      results = checker.run_checks(request.checks)
      return CheckResult(**results)

  Enterprise Features:
  - Structured responses - JSON format for automation
  - Selective checking - Choose specific analysis types
  - Error handling - Proper HTTP status codes
  - Documentation - Auto-generated OpenAPI specs

  Part 5: Real-World Analysis Example (3 minutes)

  Live Demo - Toyota Interview Project

  Input: /mnt/c/Users/ibm/Documents/gp_ai_full/toyota_interview

  Results:
  - Score: 30/100 (High Risk)
  - Issues Found: 7 problems
  - Critical Issues: None
  - Warnings: 6 security risks, 1 structure issue

  Detailed Analysis:
  🟡 [SECURITY] Use of eval() function - security risk
  📍 src/evaluation/evaluator.py:107

  🟡 [STRUCTURE] Missing .gitignore file

  Business Impact:
  - Security Risk - eval() functions can execute malicious code
  - Deployment Risk - Missing .gitignore can expose sensitive files
  - Actionable Intel - Exact file locations provided for fixes

  Part 6: Extension and Customization (2 minutes)

  Adding New Check Types

  def _check_performance(self):
      """Custom performance analysis"""
      # Check for large model files
      # Validate memory usage patterns
      # Identify potential bottlenecks

  def _check_compliance(self):
      """Regulatory compliance checks"""
      # GDPR data handling validation
      # Model explainability requirements
      # Audit trail verification

  Extension Points:
  - New Analysis Modules - Add domain-specific checks
  - Custom Scoring - Modify weights for your organization
  - Integration Hooks - Connect to monitoring systems
  - Report Formats - Export to PDF, Excel, or databases

  Industry Customization Examples:
